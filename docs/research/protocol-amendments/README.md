# Protocol amendments and administrative entries

**Protocol v1.0 has one logged amendment: v1.0-A1.** The frozen v1.0 text and the `protocol-v1.0` tag are unchanged.

**v1.0-A1 — 2026-10-01 — DATA-ROUTE / OPERATIONAL.** Owner-approved direct official TCIA access into a private, access-restricted computational environment.

- External provider authorization: **NONE**.
- TCIA response: **NONE**.
- This is the owner-approved alternative already permitted by gate B1 ("TCIA confirmation on private third-party re-hosting (or an owner-approved alternative), per §5.1 and SR7").
- Scientific impact: none.
- Methodological impact: none.
- Not authorized: third-party re-hosting, Kaggle mirroring and public redistribution.

Rules (protocol v1.0, "Freeze rule" and §25):

1. The frozen file `docs/research/FINAL_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL_v1.0.md` is never edited in place.
2. Any **design change** requires a logged amendment recording the date, version, sections, change, reason and whether any test data had been seen. The owner must approve it. No change is allowed after any test-set evaluation.
3. **Execution records** from gates B–D are appended as logged **administrative entries**. They include hashes, counts, the computed T_screen value, patient groups, split hashes and EXP-001 measurements, and do not change the pre-registered design.
4. Each amendment or administrative entry is a separate file in this directory: `YYYY-MM-DD_<gate-or-topic>.md`. Its effect on the machine-readable mirror (`configs/protocol/`) and on `docs/project_status.yaml` is committed in the same change.
